<p>The department is organized in 2017 and includes the following students: 5110300-Chemistry Teaching Methods, 5110400-Methods of Teaching Biology, 5110500 Geography Teaching Methods. At the department, along with teaching in the field of education, research works are being carried out in these areas. In particular, on the base of the chair 2 basic doctors carry out research work.</p>

<p>There are 31 professor-teachers, including 5 doctors of sciences, professors, 4 candidates of sciences - docents or philosophy (PhD). Even though the department was founded at least, the teaching literature and new laboratories created by the faculty were created and used in the educational process.</p>

<p>In order to ensure students' academic, pedagogical and qualitative practices at the highest level, they are regularly trained in the Institute of Plant Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Institute of Genetics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polymer Chemistry and Physics Institute, Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry, Maxam Chirchik Joint Stock Company, The Institute of Seismology and other organizations, which have modern material-technical base and the Tashkent regional public education institutions.</p>

<p>The organization and carrying out of research work at the faculty is at a high level. At faculty the following scientific researchers are carried out:</p>

<p>1. Obtaining interpolymer-complex materials on the basis of local raw materials;</p>

<p>2. Synthesis of new anionites based on polyvinylchloride;</p>

<p>3. Obtaining, physical-chemical properties and use of local materials based on local raw materials;</p>

<p>4. Investigate economically efficient, environmentally friendly, waste, energy and resource generation production technologies of aromatic acetylene and vinyl esters production;</p>

<p>5. Geographical problems of tourism and recreational development;</p>

<p>6. Territorial organization of agricultural networks;</p>

<p>7. Economic geographical aspects of monoculture development</p>

<p>8. Modern Immune Diagnostics of Potato Viruses</p>

<p>9. Characteristics of use of algae of aquaculture in fishing</p>

<p>10. Molecular genetic analysis of resistance to stress factors in soft wheat</p>

<p>At the department, within the framework of state scientific and technical programs, research grants for practical grants are being carried out. Nowadays, the department team works with foreign universities and institutes. In particular, it cooperates with scholars of leading higher education institutions such as the Russian State Pedagogical University named after Gertsin, the South Kazakhstan State University named after Mukhtar Avezov, the Kiev National University of Ukraine, and in the teaching and research areas.</p>
