<p>The law about “The State Flag of the Republic of Uzbekistan” was  adopted on November 18 in 1991 in the 8th session of the Supreme Council  of Uzbekistan. The flag of our country is a symbol of the sovereignty  of the Republic. The national flag of the Republic represents the  country internationally when official delegations from Uzbekistan visit  foreign countries, as well as at conferences, world exhibition, and  sports competitions. The national flag of the Republic is a right-angled  colored cloth of three horizontal stripes: blue, white and green.</p>

<p>Blue is the symbol of the sky and water, which are the main source of  life. Mainly blue was the color of the state flag of Temur.</p>

<p>White is the traditional symbol of peace and good luck, as Uzbek people say “Ok yul”.</p>

<p>Green is the color of nature and new life and good harvest.</p>

<p>Two thin red stripes symbolize the power of life.</p>

<p>There is a new moon, which symbolizes the newly independent Republic.  There are twelve stars, which stand for spiritual sign. The stars also  signify the historical traditions of the Uzbek people, as well as  ancient solar calendar. A particular attention to twelve stars in the  flag is explained yet by another suggestion, that in the states  previously existed in the territory of modern Uzbekistan the scientific  thought as “Astrology” had seen its rise. The stars in the Uzbek flag  also point to the ancient roots of local culture, the aspirations of  Uzbek people towards perfection and loyalty.</p>
